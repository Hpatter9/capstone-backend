Hello fellow learners!

Here are the steps to test and review my project:

1. activate venv

2. move into the littlelemon project folder

3. run tests with: python manage.py test tests/

4. End point to see the static image and text:

/restaurant

5. Browsable endpoints

/restaurant/menu/
/restaurant/booking/

6. to create a user for a token

/auth/user/

7. to get a token:

/auth/token/login

Enjoy! 

...Even though it's pretty boring...
